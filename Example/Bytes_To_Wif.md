# Bytes (seed) To WIF

### Generated Bytes and Convert To WIF

Generated and Convert Bytes To WIF `Compressed`:
```python
from Blockthon import Wallet
# generated random bytes without repeat
byte = Wallet.getSeed()
# Convert Bytes To WIF Compress:
WifCompress = Wallet.Bytes_To_Wif(byte, compress=True)
```

Generated and Convert Bytes To WIF `UnCompressed`:
```python
from Blockthon import Wallet
# generated random bytes without repeat
byte = Wallet.getSeed()
# Convert Bytes To WIF Compress:
WifCompress = Wallet.Bytes_To_Wif(byte, compress=False)
```
